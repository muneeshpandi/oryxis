//! Full-vault snapshot encode/decode for the SFTP sync transport.
//!
//! P2P sync negotiates a delta over a live QUIC/relay session. The SFTP
//! transport has no peer to talk to, only a file: it treats that file as
//! a "virtual peer" and exchanges the whole vault state every round. The
//! reconciliation itself is identical to P2P, this module just reuses the
//! manifest bricks (`build_manifest` / `collect_records` / `apply_records`)
//! to turn the vault into one sealed blob and back.
//!
//! A round on a device is: download the remote blob, [`merge_snapshot`]
//! it into the local vault (LWW + tombstones, same as a `DeltaPush`),
//! then [`build_full_snapshot`] the now-merged vault and upload it. Each
//! device keeps its own local state and tombstones, so a lost upload race
//! self-heals on the next round.

/// v2 (protocol v6) moved the outer + per-record seal to
/// XChaCha20-Poly1305 (24-byte nonce). A v1 blob (ChaCha20, 12-byte
/// nonce, shipped in v0.8.3) is rejected here on the version byte
/// rather than fed to the wider-nonce cipher: the reject is
/// non-destructive (the caller refuses to push after a failed merge),
/// which matches the coordinated re-sync a v6 bump expects.
///
/// v3 (protocol v7) is a schema gate: the record payloads gained enum
/// variants a protocol-v6 client cannot deserialize (certificate auth,
/// sk- key algorithms). The crypto is identical to v2, so reads accept
/// BOTH versions (a v7 client understands every v2 payload) and writes
/// stamp v3; an old client rejects a v3 blob loudly at this header
/// instead of silently warn-skipping records it cannot parse.
///
/// v4 (protocol v8) is the same kind of schema gate, one level up:
/// `EntityType` itself gained a variant (`LoginScript`). A record whose
/// entity type an older build does not know is worse than an unreadable
/// payload, because the type is what the reader dispatches on, so the
/// whole record list fails to deserialize rather than one entry. Crypto
/// is again unchanged, so reads still accept v2 and v3 and writes stamp
/// v4.
///
/// v5 (0.20.0): `AuthMethod::SecurityKey`, a payload variant a v4 reader
/// cannot deserialize; since the record list is decoded whole, one such
/// host failed the entire merge on an older build. Reads accept v2 and
/// up, writes stamp v5.
