//! Host-card multi-selection, "Move to group" and the card drag onto a
//! folder (issue #230): the three doors through which a host changes
//! folder without opening its editor.
//!
//! The selection itself is built by Ctrl / Shift + click, by the check
//! on a card, and by Space on a ringed card. The toolbar's multi-select
//! mode is the fourth way in, and the only discoverable one: while it is
//! on, every card click toggles instead of dialling, so a batch is
//! gathered by pointing at cards. Ctrl+click alone is invisible to
//! anyone who does not already know it exists.
//!
//! A move is an EDIT: `group_id` set, `updated_at` stamped,
//! `save_connection(conn, None)` (the password column untouched), the
//! same shape as the folder-delete re-home in `groups.rs`. That is the
//! opposite of the `last_used` stamp on connect, which is deliberately
//! a narrow UPDATE because connecting is not an edit; moving is one,
//! and must out-rank an older copy under last-writer-wins.
