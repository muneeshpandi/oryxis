//! Keyboard router for the modal / overlay-menu layer.
//!
//! Runs from the `|v| Message::Terminal(TerminalMessage::KeyboardEvent(v))` arm in `dispatch_terminal.rs`
//! BEFORE the vault keynav router: while a navigable modal, dropdown
//! menu or the burger menu is open, this layer owns the movement and
//! activation keys. It never consumes Esc (that stays with
//! `close_topmost_modal` in `shortcuts.rs`) and never consumes
//! printable characters (picker search fields keep receiving them
//! through iced's real focus).
//!
//! Selection is INDEX-based over `RowAction`s recorded during view()
//! (see `keynav/slots.rs`), tagged with a `ModalSurface` so a stale
//! selection from a previous surface is inert. Three families:
//!
//! - Confirm dialogs: open with the ring on their default (action)
//!   button, Enter/Space activate, Tab and arrows cycle the buttons.
//! - Search pickers (new-tab, tab-jump, group pickers): typing stays
//!   in the input, Up/Down move the row selection, Enter activates
//!   the selection or the top match.
//! - Row menus (kebabs, sort, overflow, burger): open with the first
//!   row ringed, Up/Down move, Enter/Space fire the row's click
//!   message (mouse parity, including how the menu closes).
